                    <h3>FAQs</h3>


                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4> What are EMD Vouchers:</h4>
                            <p>
                                EMD vouchers are Electronic Miscellaneous Document issued via the airline with the same
                                value of an original ticket paid to the airline which can be used by same passengers to
                                purchase
                                another ticket with same airline for a future date.
                            </p>
                            <p> The vouchers are usually valued for one year or based on the initial validity of your
                                original
                                ticket and can be used to buy a new ticket on any future travel date.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4> What are Open Tickets:</h4>
                            <p> Most airlines have allowed passengers to leave tickets open allowing the customer to
                                make a change
                                in the future. Not all airlines allow one free change on your flight ticket, which gives
                                customers
                                time to decide after the pandemic to utilize the flight ticket.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h4> Status on Refunds:</h4>
                            <p> A recent open letter by International Air Transport Association (IATA) on refunds by the
                                airline
                                states that; “Our industry is experiencing a critical liquidity crisis. Most airlines
                                are spending
                                more cash in reimbursing their passengers than they receive in new booking revenues. We
                                recently
                                estimated the industry’s liability in this area at $35 billion. In this context,
                                airlines’ most
                                urgent need is to keep their remaining liquidity to pay salaries and face their fixed 2
                                costs. It is
                                practically impossible for industry players to find sufficient financial means to keep
                                the air
                                travel value chain operating in the short time that airlines have before facing
                                bankruptcy.”</p>

                            <p> We have seen delays in refunds process from the airline which we can no longer determine
                                when the
                                funds will be paid to the company to reimburse our customers, hence we have been advised
                                to
                                offer
                                customers EMD vouchers or leave the tickets open for a future travel
